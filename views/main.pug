        div.aboutme
            p I am a self-taught web developer, although we can say I am a Full Stack Web Developer, well you know, after learning one thing, I had to learn another thing, and then that same thing needed to be used with another thing, and it went like that for a while.
            p I do not consider myself an expert in any matter, but I like to learn, which I consider a must-have skill.
